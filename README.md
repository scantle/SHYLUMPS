# SHYLUMPS (Simple Hydrological LUMPed-model System)
---

## Overview

SHYLUMPS (Simple Hydrological LUMPed-model System) is a Fortran-based hydrological modeling tool designed for educational and research purposes. This model simulates rainfall-runoff processes and estimates streamflow using a simplified lumped conceptual approach.

SHYLUMPS aims to provide a clear and accessible example of hydrological modeling, making it suitable for teaching, research, and preliminary watershed analyses. Eventually, the hope is SHYLUMPS can be used for simple watershed calibration experiments.

**At the moment, SHYLUMPS tends to accumulate water, likely due to oversimplifications of the snow and snow melt processes.**

## Features

- **Rainfall and Snow Partitioning**: Distinguishes between rain and snow based on temperature thresholds.
- **Snowmelt Calculation**: Incorporates a temperature-based snowmelt algorithm.
- **Quickflow and Baseflow Separation**: Simulates fast-response runoff and slower groundwater contributions to streamflow.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Supports user-defined coefficients and initial storage values for flexible model setups.
- **Streamflow Calculation**: Outputs streamflow in mÂ³/s, converted from daily totals.
- **Fortran Codebase**: Demonstrates efficient and structured hydrological modeling in Fortran.

For now, the only accepted climate forcings are **Precipitation**, **Average Temperature**, and **Evapotranspiration** input in millimeters per day, except temperature, which is in degrees celsius. The code is hardcoded to run on **daily timesteps**.

## Requirements

### Fortran Compiler

Ensure you have a Fortran compiler installed (e.g., `gfortran` or Intel Fortran Compiler).

### Visual Studio with the Intel Fortran Compiler (Optional)

Visual Studio 2022 Project files are provided with the project. To use them, download and install the [latest version of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (the community version is free). Then download and install the [Intel Fortran Compiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/oneapi-standalone-components.html#fortran).

## Running SHYLUMPS

SHYLUMPS is run from the command line. It requires one argument: The name of the main input file. An example set of model files is provided within the [Test/CoastForkWillamette](./Test/CoastForkWillamette/) directory. With this folder open in the command line, the following command would run the model:
```bash
SHYLUMPS CFWillamette.lump
```

## Model Files
### Main Input File
The main input file (*.lump) is an ASCII text file with text descriptions followed by values. It is required to follow this exact format:
```
# SHYLUMPS INPUT FILE

Name: [string]
Area: [real, km^2]
Days: [integer]

# Coefficients
rain_temp:         [real, degC]
snow_temp:         [real, degC]
melt_low_temp:     [real, degC]
melt_high_temp:    [real, degC]
precip_correction: [real]
et_correction:     [real]
quickflow_coef:    [real]
recharge_coef:     [real]
baseflow_coef:     [real]
gw_loss_coef:      [real]

# Initial Storage Values
init_snow: [real, mm]
init_soil: [real, mm]
init_gw:   [real, mm]

# Input Files
Forcings: [string]
```
where bracketed items [ ] need to be replaced with data of the type listed in the bracket. Units are given where necessary. See [Test/CoastForkWillamette/CFWillamette.lump](./Test/CoastForkWillamette/CFWillamette.lump) for an example.

### Forcings Input File
The forcing file consists of a header line and then rows (matching the number of days given in the main input file) consisting of 4 values: **Date**, **Precipitation**, **Average Temperature**, and **Evapotranspiration** input in millimeters per day, except temperature, which is in degrees celsius.
Here is the first couple lines from [Test/CoastForkWillamette/forcings.dat](./Test/CoastForkWillamette/forcings.dat):

```
Note that the date is simply stored as a string to be written in the output file: no date processing is done within the program.

### Output File
Streamflow (in m^3/s) is currently the only state variable written to an output file. It is written to the shylumps.out file:
